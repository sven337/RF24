I use this to store a somewhat custom version of the RF24 lib, as nobody ever stepped up to be the maintainer of the RF24 library, it is impossible to get a reasonably up-to-date version without merging from 4 different sources.
So I'm doing what everybody does on Github. http://perso.aquilenet.fr/~sven337/english/2014/05/15/The-Github-Syndrome.html
